Algorithmic Trading Application
=========
**This was part of the project outcome for the SENG3011 course in Semester 1, 2015**

Algorithm modules designed to make money on the equity market.
The Trock Testing Platform is a GUI which can utilise stragegy modules made by ourselves or other teams.
The Testing Platform features quantitive analysis, the ability to run different stragegy modules, the ability to analyse order CSV files, and much more.

The Testing Platform was written using Qt and is cross compatible with Windows, MAC OS and Linux operating systems.
Both the Testing Platform and backend were written in C++ with speed being a top priority.
The latest iteration of the software is incredibly effecient and can analyse huge input files within seconds.
